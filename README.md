# Capstone

## 1.1. The Dataset
The dataset used in this project is based on the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) Coffee Quality Database published in 2018.

The data for this analysis was taken from https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/tree/master/data.
The datasets being used are arabica_ratings_raw.csv and robusta_ratings_raw.csv.

## 1.2. Analysis Method
Our analysis plan will be undergoing following steps :

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights about the raw data, identify potential data problems, features and target variables, as well as metrics.
- Preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning. This will be done in two steps :
- Cleaning the data to remove the identified issues
-Feature Engineering to allow and prepare for use of machine learning algorithms
- Select and validate a suitable predictive Machine Learning model
- The code in this project will be written in Python.
